# 🧱 The Polygon Diaries – 3D Experiments by Mandar  
### *“These models cost me sleep, sanity, and 7,000 Ctrl+Zs.”*

## 💥 What is this?

A chaotic collection of my 3D modeling, texturing, and animation experiments made using Mandar's brainrot.  
Each project comes from a late-night session of caffeine, crashes, and creativity.

If it’s made of faces, edges, and vertices — it probably lives here.

## 🔨 What's Inside?

### 🚙 Car Disassembly & Assembly  
- A full 3D car model pulled apart piece by piece… and painfully put back together.  
- Made for motion design animation using Unreal Engine and Maya.

### 🏠 Stylized Indian House  
- Created with love, bricks, and infinite loop cuts.  
- A tribute to old desi architecture with modern lighting. Looks peaceful. Wasn’t.

### 💺 Chair Model + UV Hell  
- It’s just a chair. But the UVs? The real horror.

### ✈️ Sci-fi Drone  
- Modeled from scratch. Inspired by a mix of Valorant and YouTube tutorials that I never fully watched.  
- Smooth shading meets sharp stress.

### 🔄 Animation Practice (Rigged & Non-Rigged)  
- Bouncing balls, flying drones, and broken FK/IK setups.  
- Welcome to the crash zone.
